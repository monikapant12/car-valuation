# Objective
  To classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

# Data

   Data Overview :
   
   * We have two data files: one conatins the information about the genetic mutations and the other contains the clinical evidence (text) that human experts/pathologists use to      classify the genetic mutations.
   
   * Both these data files are have a common column called ID
   
   * Data file's information:
   
      * training_variants (ID , Gene, Variations, Class)
           
      * training_text (ID, Text)
