   #Data Overview
   
   . We have two data files: one conatins the information about the genetic mutations and the other contains the clinical evidence (text) that human experts/pathologists use to        classify the genetic mutations.
   
   . Both these data files are have a common column called ID
   
   . Data file's information:
   
           . training_variants (ID , Gene, Variations, Class)
           
           . training_text (ID, Text)
