# Objective
Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

# Data

Data Description:

* There are nine different classes a genetic mutation can be classified on.

* This is not a trivial task since interpreting clinical evidence is very challenging even for human specialists. Therefore, modeling the clinical evidence (text)          will be critical for the success of your approach.

* Both, training and test, data sets are provided via two different files. One (training/test_variants) provides the information about the genetic mutations, whereas the other (training/test_text) provides the clinical evidence (text) that our human experts used to classify the genetic mutations. Both are linked via the ID field.

* Therefore the genetic mutation (row) with ID=15 in the file training_variants, was classified using the clinical evidence (text) from the row with ID=15 in the file training_text

* Finally, to make it more exciting!! Some of the test data is machine-generated to prevent hand labeling. You will submit all the results of your classification algorithm, and we will ignore the machine-generated samples.
