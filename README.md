# Objective
Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passangeras). We need to develop a Machine Learning algorithm that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations.

# Data

.There are nine different classes a genetic mutation can be classified on.

.This is not a trivial task since interpreting clinical evidence is very challenging even for human specialists. Therefore, modeling the clinical evidence (text) will be critical for the success of your approach.

.Both, training and test, data sets are provided via two different files. One (training/test_variants) provides the information about the genetic mutations, whereas the other (training/test_text) provides the clinical evidence (text) that our human experts used to classify the genetic mutations. Both are linked via the ID field.

.Therefore the genetic mutation (row) with ID=15 in the file training_variants, was classified using the clinical evidence (text) from the row with ID=15 in the file training_text

.Finally, to make it more exciting!! Some of the test data is machine-generated to prevent hand labeling. You will submit all the results of your classification algorithm, and we will ignore the machine-generated samples.
