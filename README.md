# Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment
. Personalized cancer medicine comes from studies of human genes and the genes in different cancers. These studies have helped researchers design more effective treatments. They have also used genetic information to develop tests for cancer and ways to prevent it.
. Personalized cancer medicine can have fewer side effects than other types of treatment. This is because it is designed to be more specific. A personalized treatment may affect healthy cells less and cells involved in cancer more.

Classifying genetic mutations based on clinical evidence

# Data

.There are nine different classes a genetic mutation can be classified on.

.This is not a trivial task since interpreting clinical evidence is very challenging even for human specialists. Therefore, modeling the clinical evidence (text) will be critical for the success of your approach.

.Both, training and test, data sets are provided via two different files. One (training/test_variants) provides the information about the genetic mutations, whereas the other (training/test_text) provides the clinical evidence (text) that our human experts used to classify the genetic mutations. Both are linked via the ID field.

.Therefore the genetic mutation (row) with ID=15 in the file training_variants, was classified using the clinical evidence (text) from the row with ID=15 in the file training_text

.Finally, to make it more exciting!! Some of the test data is machine-generated to prevent hand labeling. You will submit all the results of your classification algorithm, and we will ignore the machine-generated samples.
